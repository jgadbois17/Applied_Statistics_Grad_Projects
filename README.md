# Projects: Applied Statistics Graduate Program
## California State University, Long Beach



The purpose of this repository is to keep all of my class projects from my master's program organized and in one place. 

I graduated with my Bachelor's degree in mathematics with an option in statistics from CSULB in May 2019. From there, I went straight into a master's program in applied statistics at CSULB. My first semester was Fall 2019.
