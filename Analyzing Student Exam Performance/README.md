# Assessing Student Time Management to Obtain Insights for Academic Struggles

## Experimental Design & Analysis 

This project presented the struggle of getting randomly assigned a design and having to create our own experiment to obtain data. My partner worked at a tutoring center at the time, and was able to use his students and their test grades in their calculus class for our experiment.

# Project Procedures 

## Design 
Constructed the design with a defining relation producing a resolution IV design since no main effects are aliased with any other main effect or two-factor effect, but the two-factor effects are aliased with each other. 

## Analysis of Variance 
After performing ANOVA, our final reduced model consisted of just three main effects and two two-factor interaction effects. 

## Tukey's Multiple Comparison Procedures 
This was used to see which main effects and interaction effects were significantly different. 

# Results 
After our analysis was complete, we found that the average commute time had the biggest impact on the students performance on their exams. While this may seem odd, it makes sense because their class started at 7:30 AM, so the longer their commute, the earlier they have to wake up in the morning, which could result in the not being fully awake for the time of their exam.
