# Forecasting Pharmaceutical Drug Sales Volume

## Time Series Analysis

This project considers four classes of pharmaceutical drugs and their sales volumes over time. 

**My Contributions to the Project:** 

* All R programming 
* Research question ideas 

# Methodology

* STL outlier removal 
* Stationarity testing 
* ARIMA modeling and forecasting

# Software

* R Statistical Software and RStudio
* tidyverse 
* tidyquant
* timetk
* tseries
* astsa
* sweep
* forecast
* ggfortify

Note that the packages must be loaded in that order to avoid conflicting functions. 

# Project Procedures 

1. Plot time series with Loess curve 
2. Split data 
2. Plot sample ACF and PACF 
3. ADF test for stationarity 
4. Differencing if needed: repeat steps 3 and 4 
5. Model Selection 
6. Model Diagnostics 
7. Forecasting future time steps 

# Results 

The data had observations from the first week of 2014 to the 41st week of 2019. We forecasted the last 11 weeks of 2019 for each time seris.
